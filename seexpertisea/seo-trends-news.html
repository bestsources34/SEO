Google Analytics remains an indispensable tool for monitoring website traffic sources, user behavior, and overall engagement metrics. Freelancers should aim for a logical hierarchy in site design with clear navigation paths which could include breadcrumb menus and clean URLs. Additionally, reviews generate fresh user-generated content which keeps your pages dynamic for both users and search engines. For e-commerce sites, this includes fast loading times, mobile responsiveness, easy navigation, and clear calls-to-action. Freelance marketers specializing in SEO need to ensure that these technical requirements are met to support both direct user interactions and backend optimizations favorable for search engines.
