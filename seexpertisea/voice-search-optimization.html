These elements help search engines understand the context of your content better and index it accordingly. They help in identifying trends, analyzing competitors, and understanding performance metrics that influence a website's search engine ranking. <br><br>  This is because visitors who search using long-tail keywords often have a clear intent and are looking for exactly what they want. <b>SERP (Search Engine Results Pages)</b>  These include implementing responsive design, optimizing image sizes and formats for faster loading times, and ensuring clickable elements are spaced out appropriately for touch accuracy.
