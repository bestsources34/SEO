<div><p>The Impact on Keyword ResearchTraditional keyword research methods are evolving. This insight allows you to refine both your overall content strategy and individual pieces of content posted both on-site (blogs) and through various social channels. Tools like Google's PageSpeed Insights can be invaluable in this phase to identify any shortcomings that could hinder search engine indexing or user experience. These often tend to be local and immediate, such as searching for nearby services or obtaining quick answers.
