Common challenges include dealing with high competition in generic keywords, creating unique content across similar product pages, ensuring all products are indexed correctly by search engines despite vast inventories, and integrating effective e-commerce SEO practices that align with business sales goals. Additionally, integrating JSON-LD scripts into webpages is recommended for dynamically inserting meta-tags without altering the HTML coding structure. <br><br>  Detailed and keyword-rich product descriptions help boost SEO by improving page relevance on search engines.
