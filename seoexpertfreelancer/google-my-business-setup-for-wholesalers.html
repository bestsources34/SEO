For e-commerce sites, this means focusing on keyword integration in product descriptions, meta tags, ALT tags for images, and ensuring each page has unique content that adds value to the user's shopping experience. These snippets should accurately summarize the content of the page while incorporating target keywords to boost relevance in searches. Should Wholesale Distributors Focus on Local SEO Tactics?
