For wholesale distributors, focusing on three main types of keywords is crucial: 'Product-specific keywords' which directly describe what you're selling (e.g., "bulk organic almonds"), 'Industry-specific keywords' that capture the broader category or industry terms (e.g., "wholesale food suppliers"), and 'Long-tail keywords', which are more specific phrases likely to be used by customers further down the buying funnel (e.g., "best price bulk organic almonds in California").2.
