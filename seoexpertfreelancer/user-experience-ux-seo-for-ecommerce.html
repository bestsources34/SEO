For wholesale distributors, focusing on three main types of keywords is crucial: 'Product-specific keywords' which directly describe what you're selling (e.g., "bulk organic almonds"), 'Industry-specific keywords' that capture the broader category or industry terms (e.g., "wholesale food suppliers"), and 'Long-tail keywords', which are more specific phrases likely to be used by customers further down the buying funnel (e.g., "best price bulk organic almonds in California").2.

Analyzing Traffic SourcesUnderstanding where your traffic comes from is vital for any eCommerce business.
