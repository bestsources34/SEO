<div><p>Defining the Key PlayersWhen considering search engine optimization (SEO) services, businesses typically have two main options: hiring a freelance SEO expert or contracting an SEO agency. A freelance SEO expert must quickly identify which aspects of their current strategies may potentially lead to penalties or reduced rankings. Freelance SEO experts need to manage expectations realistically by educating clients about potential fluctuations in rankings and traffic following major updates. What is the Difference Between a Freelance SEO Expert and an SEO Agency? These insights guide the direction of keyword research and overall SEO strategy.

A fresh set of eyes examining your processes and strategies can unearth overlooked opportunities or inefficiencies that could be improved. A freelance SEO specialist ensures that all elements of a client's website-such as HTML tags, headlines, images, and structured data-are optimized according to best practices. In contrast, agencies have access to numerous professionals each specializing in different branches of SEO thus enabling them to tackle comprehensive strategies that address multiple elements of digital marketing simultaneously.
