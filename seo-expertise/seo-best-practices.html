<div><p>Content Optimization and Keyword ResearchMuch of an SEO freelancer's day is dedicated to operational tasks such as content creation, optimization, and conducting thorough keyword research. Keywords are categorized into informational, navigational, transactional or commercial investigations. Many also spend this time responding to emails from clients and scheduling meetings or calls that need to happen throughout the day. The goal is to find balance; targeting both high-volume keywords that attract more visits and niche-specific terms that are less competitive. If you find that your rankings are stagnant or declining despite efforts to improve, this could be a sign that professional help is needed. Addressing these technical elements helps eliminate barriers that could impede crawling and indexing by search engines.

Considering the Scale of Your BusinessThe size and scope of your business play a critical role in deciding whether you need an SEO freelancer. If there were instances where lack of specific knowledge led to missed opportunities or ineffective execution, bringing in a specialist might turn things around. These discussions can lead to immediate tasks like tweaking a content strategy or revising keywords which will be addressed later in the workday. <br><br>  Request detailed explanations of past projects that showcase their proficiency in these areas to ensure they have a holistic understanding of SEO.

This requires a thorough audit of existing client websites to pinpoint areas that need immediate adjustment to comply with the new norms. This involves analyzing keyword trends, understanding competitive landscapes, and integrating these insights into content creation and website structuring.
