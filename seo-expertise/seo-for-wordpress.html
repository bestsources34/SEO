<p>Content Optimization and Keyword ResearchMuch of an SEO freelancer's day is dedicated to operational tasks such as content creation, optimization, and conducting thorough keyword research. Keywords are categorized into informational, navigational, transactional or commercial investigations. Many also spend this time responding to emails from clients and scheduling meetings or calls that need to happen throughout the day. The goal is to find balance; targeting both high-volume keywords that attract more visits and niche-specific terms that are less competitive.
